# [WIP] vue-ctx-injector

## Preamble

*During a complete refactoring of a company's big project, integrating Vue.js to
replace a very old code architecture was almost a necessity to keep a
well-working website.  
The problem was the lack of time to allow to a one-shot refactoring on the
project, and a progressive transition was the only solution.*

*After looking a long time for tools or libraries to progressively integrate
Vue.js components into the project, the choice has been made to creating a
dedicated package for that.*

## Introduction

VCI is a tiny tool for injecting standalone components with Vue.js context into
basic HTML templates, while keeping it updated by simply manipulating
component-related HTML elements.

## Installation

Soon...
